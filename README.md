# Music Releases
The first React project for the Technigo Bootcamp made with pair-programmaing. The task was to display recent music realases from an api using React and JavaScript. 

## The problem

We structured the site by dividing the different pieces of information React componets such as 'Artists', 'Albums' and 'Icons' and then mounted them together. 

If we had more time we would go for the strecth goals which was to add a playlist.
